- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeonOpperman. I straddle two worlds, with one foot in the entertainment industry as a writer and producer for television and stage, and the other foot in business and entrepreneurship, wih an M.B.A. from the University of the Witwatersrand.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 with specific focus on dApps that function as bridges between Web2 and Web3; dApps that bring the benefits and efficiencies of Web3 tech to users that are NOT Web3 tech literate.  In other words: back-end = Web3, front-end looks and feels like using Web 2 app, and accepts fiat payments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web3 development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...  my email: deonopperman6@gmail.com
